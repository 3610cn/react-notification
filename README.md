React Notification is a component designed to provide snackbar notification messages and notification stacks. The default visual style and interaction follows [Material Design guidelines for snackbars](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/snackbars-toasts.html#snackbars-toasts-usage), but it can be fully customized.
