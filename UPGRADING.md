# 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

The 2.0.0 release is a stateless component with no methods to show and hide the component. Instead, you need to use the `isActive` prop to control the active (visible) state of your property. This feature also allows you to have multiple notifications, which is demonstrated in the example.

The `dissmissAfter` prop is also depreciated.

If you need any help or have questions, please feel free to create an issue.
